# Prettier Lichess

Here is the source code for both the chrome and firefox extension! It's simple but it's mine. Feel free to download, fork, use, and mess with it all you want. No attribution or anything required.

## Usage and General Info

Lichess is an amazing platform that has more than just the ability to play chess, and all for free. Unfortunately I felt like it didn't show this well with it's current design, nor did it show it was a site that resides in 2021. Now with Prettier Lichess, Lichess becomes more readable, more discoverable, and prettier (plus customizable colors)!

## Development workflow

- Run `npm install` to get all packages
- Run `npm run watch` to have webpack start watching your files. All output files will be built in `./dist`
- As an alternative, you can use `npm run build` for a one-shot build
- That's pretty much it :)
