[Lichess](https://lichess.org/) is an amazing platform that has more than just the ability to play chess, and all for free. Unfortunately I felt like it didn't show this well with it's current design, nor did it show it was a site that resides in 2022. Now with Prettier Lichess, Lichess becomes more readable, more discoverable, and prettier (plus customizable colors)!

## Code and license

Here is the source code for both the chrome and firefox extension! It's simple but it's mine. Feel free to download, fork, use, and mess with it all you want. No attribution or anything required.

## General Usage

To install the extension, go to the official website for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/prettier-lichess) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prettier-lichess/epgnobcgnmchnhgkgpedebbmhbblfcob). Set Lichess to dark background to have the best compatibility with prettierlichess. \
With the pop-up you can then customise the colours and choose themes. Have fun!

## Community Themes

Check out the community driven theme library [here](https://github.com/algertc/prettierlichess-themes).

## Development workflow

### Setup

Execute this command for the setup to get all packages:

```
npm install
```

### Build

During the build, the output files from webpack are placed in the `.dist/` folder. There are two ways to start this process. For a single build, run:

```
npm run build
```

To rebuild automatically when changes are made, run:

```
npm run watch
```

That's pretty much it :smiley:
